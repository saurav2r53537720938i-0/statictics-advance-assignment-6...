    "2. Two-way ANOVA:This is used when you have two independent variables(factor) and one dependent variable.it allows you to examine the main effect of each independent.\n",
    "3. Repeated measure ANOVA:This is  used when you have a within subject design meaning that each participant is measured multiples times under difrrent condtions.it often used in longitudnial studies or experiment."
